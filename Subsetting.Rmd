This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Quiz:
4.2.6
Q3: When should you use drop = FALSE?
```{r}
#By default, subsetting a matrix or data frame with a single number, a single name, or a logical vector containing a single TRUE, will simplify the returned output, i.e. it will return an object with lower dimensionality. To preserve the original dimensionality, you must use drop = FALSE.

a <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
str(a[1, ])

str(a[1, , drop = FALSE])

df <- data.frame(a = 1:2, b = 1:2)
str(df[, "a"])

str(df[,"a", drop = FALSE])

#When writing functions, get in the habit of always using drop = FALSE when subsetting a 2D object. For this reason, tibbles default to drop = FALSE, and [ always returns another tibble.
```

Q1:Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors:
mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 4, ]
mtcars[-1:4, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]

```{r}
mt <- mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4,] #replacing = with == will solve the problem

mtcars[-(1:4), ] #plus and minus can not be used at the same time but putting them in a bracket then select the rows 4 

mtcars[mtcars$cyl <= 5,] # the , was missing 

mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4:6, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 6, ]
mtcars[mtcars$cyl %in% c(4, 6),]
#%in% means contain
```

Q2: Why does the following code yield five missing values? (Hint: why is it different from x[NA_real_]?)
x <- 1:5
x[NA]
#> [1] NA NA NA NA NA

```{r}
x <- 1:5
#NA is logical and any logical vector is recycled to the same length as the vector being subset which resulted in x[NA] becoming [1] NA NA NA NA NA
```

Q3: What does upper.tri() return? How does subsetting a matrix with it work? Do we need any additional subsetting rules to describe its behaviour?

x <- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = "*")
x[upper.tri(x)]

```{r}
x <- outer(1:5, 1:5, FUN = "*")
upper.tri(x)
x[upper.tri(x)]
```

Q4: Why does mtcars[1:20] return an error? How does it differ from the similar mtcars[1:20, ]?
```{r}
mtcars[1:20,] # without the , it didn't work because the matrix has only 11 columns
```

Q5: Implement your own function that extracts the diagonal entries from a matrix (it should behave like diag(x) where x is a matrix).
```{r}
diag2 <- function(x) {
  n <- min(nrow(x), ncol(x))
  idx <- cbind(seq_len(n), seq_len(n))
  x[idx]
}
(x <- matrix(1:30, 5))
diag(x)
```
Q6:What does df[is.na(df)] <- 0 do? How does it work?
```{r}
#in the matrix df the  NA is replaced by 0
```
